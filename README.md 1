Project Tasks Overview
This README provides a detailed overview of the tasks completed for deploying a simple Node.js application in a Docker container, creating a Kubernetes deployment configuration, and provisioning resources and configuration management through Terraform and Ansible.

Task 1: Simple Node.js Application Deployment on Docker Container
Description
This task involves creating a Dockerfile to deploy a simple Node.js application that listens on port 3000. The Dockerfile uses a lightweight base image, installs the necessary dependencies, copies the application code, and specifies the command to run the application.

Deliverables
Dockerfile
Dockerfile
# Use a lightweight node image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose application on port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
