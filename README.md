Task 1: Simple Node Js Application Deployment on Docker container
Description:
- Create a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application that listens on port 3000. The
Dockerfile should use a lightweight base image, install dependencies, copy the
application code, and specify the command to run the application.
Deliverables: Dockerfile

Task 2: K8s Deployment

Description:
- Create a Kubernetes deployment configuration file (in YAML) for a web
application. The deployment should have 3 replicas, use the nginx:latest
image, and expose port 80. The configuration should also include a liveness
probe and a readiness probe, also it should have guaranteed QOS for
deployments.
Deliverables: Kubernetes deployment YAML file
Task 3: Resource Provisioning and configuration management through

terraform and ansible

Description:
- Create a Terraform script to provision an ec2 instance with necessary security
group and VPC configurations.
- Configure instance with nginx web server and other necessary configurations
- Deploy task1 node js application on the same nginx web server through
Ansible.
Deliverables: Terraform scripts, Ansible configuration, Web server configuration files

Task 1: Docker Deployment
Description
Create a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application that listens on port 3000. The Dockerfile should use a lightweight base image, install dependencies, copy the application code, and specify the command to run the application.

Dockerfile
# Use a lightweight base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
Instructions
Build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-node-app .
Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
Task 2: Kubernetes Deployment
Description
Create a Kubernetes deployment configuration file (in YAML) for a web application. The deployment should have 3 replicas, use the nginx:latest image, and expose port 80. The configuration should also include a liveness probe and a readiness probe, also it should have guaranteed QOS for deployments.

Instructions
Apply the deployment:

kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml
Check the deployment status:

kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
Task 3: Infrastructure Provisioning
Description
Provision an EC2 instance with necessary security group and VPC configurations using Terraform, and configure the instance with an Nginx web server and other necessary configurations using Ansible.

Terraform Script
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh_http" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
